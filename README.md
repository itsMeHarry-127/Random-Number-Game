# Random-Number-Game
This application only using if-else case and while loops.

* We are going to make a game!!!
* The concept is simple: We will generate a random number 
* user will guess that number. If the user guess it right users
* will win and the game is finished.
* This is the code flow :
* 1.There will be a welcome message to user when the application started.
* 2.We will ask for username then prompt a hello message to user.
* 3.Users will be asked if they want to start the game.
* 3a.If user choose "Yes" proceed to explain the rule and let user play the game
* 3b.If user choose "No" make player chose again until user choose yes.
* 4.There will be a message explain the rule to user. User will
* guess the random that has been generated between 1-20. If user
* guessed wrong there will be hint that the answer is higher or lower than the
* user guesses. And user only got 5 guesses.
* 5.If user guesses wrong 5 times prompt message "Game Over!" and close the application.
* 6.If user guess right the first time. There will be a special message to 
* congratulate user which is different from the 2nd/3rd/4th guesses.
